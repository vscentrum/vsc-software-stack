      error: can't find Rust compiler
      
      If you are using an outdated pip version, it is possible a prebuilt wheel is available for this package but pip is not able to install from it. Installing from the wheel would avoid the need for a Rust compiler.
      
      To update pip, run:
      
          pip install --upgrade pip
      
      and then retry package installation.
      
      If you did intend to build this package from source, try installing a Rust compiler from your system package manager and ensure it is on the PATH during installation. Alternatively, rustup (available at https://rustup.rs) is the recommended way to download and update the Rust compiler toolchain.

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
