    - excused: Balazs

### Agenda

- Steven: modified easyconfigs to install 2018a software on Rocky8 has been added to https://github.com/vscentrum/vsc-software-stack/tree/site-kul/genius2rocky8
- Steven: sometimes we need a small modification to an EasyBlock (for example, a user asked for a DOLFIN installation with Trilinos, but the check for Trilinos is hard-coded in the EasyBlock). How do you deal with this?
    - Keep a directory with custom easyblocks and give preference over the ones included with EasyBuild?
        - Yes, by (always) configured EasyBuild with `$EASYBUILD_INCLUDE_EASYBLOCKS` set to `'/path/to/custom-easyblocks/*.py'`
    - Push custom easyblocks to the official repository?
        - Yes, with option to filter out specific required deps
            - `filter_req_deps = ['Trilinos']`
    - Give the custom easyblocks other names (e.g. `mydolfin`)?
    - Hook to customize EasyBuild (if possible), see https://docs.easybuild.io/hooks
    - Problem with keeping custom easyblocks is that they go out-of-date, that's not a problem when changes to easyblocks are contributed back, or when hooks are used
- Robin: building on this, sometimes specific users want a slight modification. How do you deal with this? Is there a procedure in place?
    - Pass the user an EasyConfig, but how would they build that?
    - see for example https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/easybuild
    - or custom "install_foo.sh" script that uses EasyBuild
